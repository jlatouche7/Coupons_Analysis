Coupons Data Analysis

The “Coupons” dataset gave us insight into how people with certain tendencies, interests and demographics reacted to an offer of a coupon.  
While I could spend all day talking about what I was able to glean from this data, there were a few things that I found particularly interesting when analyzing who is more/less likely to accept the coupons.
We were able to find through analyzing the accepted coupon rates for bar coupons that people who visited the bar more often were more likely to accept the coupon.
It seems obvious, but knowing this can help shape strategy moving forward.
For example, it would make sense to have special promotions where coupons are distributed to everyone at a bar and hopefully drive sales volume through the coupons. 

I was surprised with my takeaways from analyzing the coffee coupons data. 
I was able to find that gender, marital status and passenger age did not seem to have any affect on who accepted the coupon. Men and women were almost equally likely to accept the coffee coupon. 
While this doesn’t help us in knowing who is most likely to accept the coupon, we do know that we can exclude marital status, passenger age and gender as determinants of this.
Overall, the takeaways from this analysis were not particularly staggering, but it give us great insight into what factors are most important when predicting who will accept the coupon.
