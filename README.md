**Coupons Data Analysis**

The “Coupons” dataset gave me insight into how people with certain tendencies, interests and demographics reacted to an offer of a coupon.
Please see here for a Jupyter Notebook with my analysis and reccomendations: https://github.com/jlatouche7/Coupons_Analysis/blob/02e99101488ab53902bfb559448ca9b49040df06/couponscharacteristicsfinal.ipynb 
There were a few things that I found particularly interesting when analyzing who is more/less likely to accept the coupons.
I was able to find through analyzing the accepted coupon rates, for bar coupons, that people who visited the bar more often were more likely to accept the coupon.
It seems obvious, but knowing this can help shape strategy moving forward.
I would reccomend a special promotion where coupons are distributed to everyone at bars around the city in attemtpt to increase the coupon acceptance rate and drive volume.

I was surprised with my takeaways from analyzing the coffee coupons data. 
I was able to find that gender, marital status and passenger age did not seem to have any affect on who accepted the coupon. Men and women were almost equally likely to accept the coffee coupon. 
While this doesn’t help us in knowing who is most likely to accept the coupon, we do know that we can exclude marital status, passenger age and gender as determinants of this.
Overall, the takeaways from this analysis were not particularly staggering, but it give us great insight into what factors are most important when predicting who will accept the coupon.
